    "### How do you find the tangent vector to a curve in the plane when it is given as a level curve?\n",
    "### Answer: Suppose $C$ is a curve described by the equation $g(x, y) = k$. To find the tangent vector at a point $(x_0, y_0)$, first compute the gradient $\\nabla g(x, y)$.

    "### The multivariable chain rule differs from the single-variable chain rule because, rather than a single formula, it represents a general principle. In words, the theorem behind the chain rule says ***any partial derivative can be computed by looking at the chain of transformations that take the input to the output, and forming the product of the partial derivatives for each link in the chain*** (as shown in the diagrams above). It is possible to package this statement into formulas, which are given at the end of this lecture."

    "### Now let's look at how the chain rule manifests when we have a quantity $z$ that depends on two variables, $x$ and $y$, which each depend on two variables $a$ and $b$. The chain rule says that the partial derivatives of $z$ with respect to $a$ and $b$ are given by:\n",

    "### Unpacking the statement slightly, the generalized chain rule just says that the linear approximation of a composite transformation can be done one transformation at a time. In other words, to approximate the value of $\\vec{z}$  for a given $\\vec{x}$ , we can first approximate the value of $\\vec{y}$  (using the Jacobian of $\\bf{T}$) and then use this $\\vec{y}$  to make an approximation for the resulting value of $\\vec{z}$  (using the Jacobian of $\\bf{W}$). The matrix multiplication shows up in the chain rule because matrix multiplication corresponds to composition (applying one transformation, and then the other).\n",
